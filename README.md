# Thoughtful’s robotic automation factory
### Rules

# Sort the packages using the following criteria:
#
# - A package is **bulky** if its volume (Width x Height x Length) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 cm³ or when one of its dimensions is greater or equal to 150 cm.
# - A package is **heavy** when its mass is greater or equal to 20 kg.
#
# You must dispatch the packages in the following stacks:
#
# - **STANDARD**: standard packages (those that are not bulky or heavy) can be handled normally.
# - **SPECIAL**: packages that are either heavy or bulky can't be handled automatically.
# - **REJECTED**: packages that are **both** heavy and bulky are rejected.

# Implementing sort() function as sort(width, height, length, mass) without using ternary operators

**How to run:**
It is only a .py file to be executed through the terminal (powershell, cmd) and calling the function with various values specified in the function parameters.
